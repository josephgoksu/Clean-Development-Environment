# Clean Development Environment

If you have a new computer or fresh OS installation, it's hard to install all things.

I know that. Believe me.

How to use?

1.  First, `git clone git@github.com:y7usuf/Clean-Development-Environment.git` or `git clone https://github.com/y7usuf/Clean-Development-Environment.git`
2.  then go to your operating system, currently, we have only ubuntu and macOS
3.  Check the Readme file
4.  Install apps which you need
